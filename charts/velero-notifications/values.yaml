## In case you need it, you can fork this repository, build the Container image, 
## and then push it to your own Artifact Registry. Once your image is available
## in your private registry, youâ€™ll need to create a Kubernetes secret that stores 
## your registry credentials. To ensure the Helm chart references this secret correctly, 
## set the parameter imagePullSecretsName: "kubernetes-secret" in your values.yaml file.
